# test_nowrite_watchdog.sh — the ZERO-WRITE (no-progress) watchdog in _supervise. Every older timer
# measures SILENCE (byte growth / idle), so a model that streams reasoning while writing nothing never
# tripped anything (incident: two ~17-min zero-write burns on an edit task). Pins: a write-expecting
# verb (edit/yolo) alive and writeless past OSRC_NOPROGRESS_SECS enters the DISTINCT state
# `no-progress-writes` (not stalled?, not wedged) and is NOT killed by default; read-only verbs
# (run/explore) and text-delegation lanes are NEVER flagged; the hard bound fires only with an explicit
# OSRC_NOPROGRESS_KILL_SECS; a qualifying write clears the state; and the state reconciles like the
# other running states when the process dies.
