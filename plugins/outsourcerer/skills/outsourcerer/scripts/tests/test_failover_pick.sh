# test_failover_pick.sh — CROSS-HARNESS FAILOVER. Fixture/mock driven (fake CLIs on PATH stand
# in for doctor readiness; posture markers stand in for lane-down verdicts; the plan-limit blocks
# write the signal). Pins: (a) _failover_pick picks a READY lane and never a down, absent, source or
# unconsented-cash lane; same model on another harness is preferred, else the nearest tier from the
# tier table (cheaper on a tie), with consent unlocking cash lanes; (b) the plan-limit blocks leave a
# signal only for non-"answered" verdicts; (c) _failover_hop rebuilds argv for the pick and prints the
# human [failover] line; a MUTATING job is re-dispatched FRESH with a handoff note (current repo state,
# never a byte-level resume); a pinned -m is never switched silently; the hop budget stops ping-pong;
# (d) no ready harness -> the honest "every lane you have is at its limit or absent" STOP line naming the
# soonest reset and any cash lane that would need consent; (e) route_delegate wires the hop on BOTH
# dispatch paths.
